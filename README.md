## About me
Hi! My name is Paulina. I am pasisonate about **science, technology, gender equity and languages!**
I am preparing myself to become a developer. And I am loving the process.
It's has allowed me to develop new skills, know incredible people, build a community and make new friends.
_What else can I ask!!_

## What do I do?

As I mentioned, my interests are wide, and I have managed to bring everything together.
So, what do I do:
* I subtitle Scientific TV Shows for a cinema producer in Chile.
* I am the co-founder of an online initiative to make women scientist and their research more visible and acccessible, which is called **Cientificamente_mujeres** on Instagram. Take a look at social media, it's all in _Spanish_ though.:
  1. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cientificamente_mujeres/)
  2. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@cientificamentemujeres9787/streams)
  3. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cientificaMujer)
* I write opinion articles that have been published in Chilean media. (I do not write that often as I'd like). One of them is in English, and I posted it on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6866424139016736769/)
* And currently, I am preparing myself to get my first job as a developer. So,
 1. I started posting articles on LinkedIn related to this topic.
 2. I am taking 3 classes this semester.
 3. I built my first real website called [Nervetools](https://nervetools.com/).
 4. I am working on my personal branding, and logo, to build MY website.
 5. Figuring out how to make a portfolio.
 6. and a long, challenging and fun etc.
 
 Finally, here is a picture of the last talk I had in Cientificamente Mujeres.
